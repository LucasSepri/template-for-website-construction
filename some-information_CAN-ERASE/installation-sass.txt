INSTAL SASS ----- https://sass-lang.com/install

Install Anywhere (Standalone)
You can install Sass on Windows, Mac, or Linux by downloading the package for your operating system from GitHub and adding it to your PATH. That’s all—there are no external dependencies and nothing else you need to install.
Install Anywhere (npm)
If you use Node.js, you can also install Sass using npm by running

npm install -g sass

However, please note that this will install the pure JavaScript implementation of Sass, which runs somewhat slower than the other options listed here. But it has the same interface, so it’ll be easy to swap in another implementation later if you need a bit more speed!
Install on Windows (Chocolatey)
If you use the Chocolatey package manager for Windows, you can install Dart Sass by running

choco install sass



Install on Mac OS X or Linux (Homebrew)
If you use the Homebrew package manager for Mac OS X or Linux, you can install Dart Sass by running

brew install sass / sass / sass
